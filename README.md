A common breakfast snack from Rajasthan, pyaaz ki kachoris are yummy kachoris stuffed with onions, spices and garnished with chutneys and dahi.I am not a huge fan of kachori recipe but i have a special place for pyaz ki kachori recipe, and it is mostly due to its onion based stuffing. generally, the stuffing for kachori made with moong dal, peas or even potatoes makes it a dry snack with very little moisture. but the onion has some moisture and thus making it juicy at the same time flaky and crisp. in addition to it, the chaat recipes made out of onion kachori are more flavoured and tasty compared to others. hence most of the time i end up making this kachori well ahead in advance and can be served as a snack or chaat dish with chutney and sev toppings.
